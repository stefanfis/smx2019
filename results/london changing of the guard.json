Every 10 minutes, he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry will do this four to five times before halting. He will then shoulder arms and stand at ease. Standing \"easy\" is not permitted whilst a sentry is at post. Orders for sentry duty read out before each 2 hour 'tour of duty', make it clear to each individual that: \"you may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during your tour of duty\".[17]\n\nSentries receive instruction on how to eliminate nuisance or any suggestion of threat from members of the public. There is a protocol they follow which begins with \"stamping\" (coming to attention sharply). He will also shout: \"Stand back from the guard\" or words to that effect. If this does not eliminate the nuisance or threat he will repeat the stamp and shout again. If the nuisance or threat still does not cease the sentry will assume the position of \"port arms\" whereby he points his rifle at the source of the interference with his duties. If these warnings are not heeded the sentry then has the choice of detaining the person(s) himself or pressing the button in his sentry box to summon assistance.[17]\n\nIf a person or persons step in front of a sentry while he is marching he will shout: \"Make way for the Queen's guard\". (Or Castle guard/Tower of London guard/Windsor Castle guard etc.).\n\nWhile The Foot Guards are also fully operational soldiers, part of their duties is guarding The Queen and her residences. The duty of mounting 'Queen's Guard' as it is known within the Army is one which many also take on with great pride. The guards remain a fully functional part of royal defences though through the years they have become a tourist attraction.\n\nAlthough formerly the guards were able to be positioned among the public, in recent times, more and more of the sentry posts have been moved away from the public because of incidents involving tourists interfering with the guards' job. Most recently, the sentry posts at Clarence House were moved behind a chain linked fence when a guardsman in the Coldstream Guards assaulted a tourist who was mocking him, pretending to march alongside him and eventually grabbing the shoulder on which his rifle was resting.

Every 10 minutes, he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry will do this four to five times before halting. He will then shoulder arms and stand at ease. Standing \"easy\" is not permitted whilst a sentry is at post. Orders for sentry duty read out before each 2 hour 'tour of duty', make it clear to each individual that: \"you may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during your tour of duty\".[17]\n\nSentries receive instruction on how to eliminate nuisance or any suggestion of threat from members of the public. There is a protocol they follow which begins with \"stamping\" (coming to attention sharply). He will also shout: \"Stand back from the guard\" or words to that effect. If this does not eliminate the nuisance or threat he will repeat the stamp and shout again. If the nuisance or threat still does not cease the sentry will assume the position of \"port arms\" whereby he points his rifle at the source of the interference with his duties. If these warnings are not heeded the sentry then has the choice of detaining the person(s) himself or pressing the button in his sentry box to summon assistance.[17]\n\nIf a person or persons step in front of a sentry while he is marching he will shout: \"Make way for the Queen's guard\". (Or Castle guard/Tower of London guard/Windsor Castle guard etc.).\n\nWhile The Foot Guards are also fully operational soldiers, part of their duties is guarding The Queen and her residences. The duty of mounting 'Queen's Guard' as it is known within the Army is one which many also take on with great pride.

Walking Tour", "description": "A first-person perspective London walk tour around Horse Guards Parade to see the Changing of The Guard. \n\nSee all the sights as Watched Walker (yes, I\u2019m talking about myself in the third person!) takes us on a walking tour through the streets of London, featuring the Changing of The Queen\u2019s Life Guard at Horse Guards Parade (also know as Changing of the Horse Guards). \n\nThe route begins off Horse Guards Road on Horse Guards Parade as the horses are entering from the front for the start of the daily ceremony, then skips to the next part of the ceremony when the horses leave, before travelling through the Horse Guards building into the front courtyard where the hourly changing of two mounted sentries occurs, ending on Whitehall at the front entrance.\n\nSights seen along the tour include the daily Changing of The Queen\u2019s Life Guard ceremony, Guards Division Memorial, statues of Field Marshal Earl Roberts and Field Marshal Lord Wolseley, The Household Cavalry Museum, dismounted sentries, and the changing of the two mounted sentries.\n\nAnd in each video I've hidden a blinking eye, can you spot it? (It could appear more than once). In addition to the blinking eye, I've also added the Watched Walker logo to various scenes\u2013it could be on buildings, vehicles or any other objects, so keep an eye out for it too!\n\nFootage recorded May/June 2017.\n\nSUBSCRIBE!\nSubscribe to my channel - https://www.youtube.com/watchedwalker?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\n\nLET\u2019S CONNECT!\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/watchedwalker\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchedwalker\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/watchedwalker\n\nGEAR I USE:\n- iPhone 6: https://www.apple.com/iphone/\n- Gimbal Stabiliser: http://amzn.to/2lGgU7E\n- Case for Stabiliser: http://amzn.to/2DRE5n8\n- Microphone: http://amzn.to/2ECEI5f\n- Power Brick: http://amzn.to/2CxyqFy\n- Portable Hard Drive: http://amzn.to/2A6C1Fe\n\nSubscribe for weekly videos! - https://www.youtube.com/watchedwalker?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- Watched Walker\n\n\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\n\nWatched Walker is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.co.uk.\n\n\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\u25c7\n\n#ChangingOfTheGuard #HorseGuardsParade #LondonWalk #LondonTour #LondonWalks #CityWalks #WatchedWalker", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGuFIM-iL94/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGuFIM-iL94/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGuFIM-iL94/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGuFIM-iL94/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGuFIM-iL94/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Watched Walker", "tags": ["london walk", "walking in london", "changing of the queen\u2019s life guard ceremony", "changing of the horse guards", "household cavalry mounted regiment", "guards division memorial", "field marshal earl roberts statue", "field marshal lord wolseley statue", "the household cavalry museum", "dismounted sentries", "mounted sentries", "england", "uk", "london sightseeing", "exploring london", "visit london", "eyes", "travel", "walking", "tour", "sightseeing", "exploring", "city", "architecture", "best london walk tour", "watched walker"], "categoryId": "19", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "London's Changing of the Guard at Horse Guards Parade - Walking Tour", "description": "A first-person perspective London walk tour around Horse Guards Parade to see the Changing of The Guard. \n\nSee all the sights as Watched Walker (yes, I\u2019m talking about myself in the third person!) takes us on a walking tour through the streets of London, featuring the Changing of The Queen\u2019s Life Guard at Horse Guards Parade (also know as Changing of the Horse Guards). \n\nThe route begins off Horse Guards Road on Horse Guards Parade as the horses are entering from the front for the start of the daily ceremony, then skips to the next part of the ceremony when the horses leave, before travelling through the Horse Guards building into the front courtyard where the hourly changing of two mounted sentries occurs, ending on Whitehall at the front entrance.\n\nSights seen along the tour include the daily Changing of The Queen\u2019s Life Guard ceremony, Guards Division Memorial, statues of Field Marshal Earl Roberts and Field Marshal Lord Wolseley, The Household Cavalry Museum, dismounted sentries, and the changing of the two mounted sentries.\n\nAnd in each video I've hidden a blinking eye, can you spot it?
