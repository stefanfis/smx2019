Market Research To Compare Keywords, Topics & Niches, Fast!", "description": "How to use Google Trends for internet marketers... The 2019 edition! Learn how to leverage Google's data to compare trends in keywords, niches and topic ideas in seconds. Use Google Trends for your market research to get a competitive edge on your competition, every time!\n\nGoogle trends was officially launched in May of 2006 and has become one of the world's most powerful niche and market research tool available free to you, every day!\n\nWhether you are trying to compare keyword search volume over time, or identifying which niches are currently trending to focus your marketing efforts, with a few clicks of the mouse you will be able to visually identify what is trending in the mindset of your target audience.\n\nIf you want more help with keyword research and how to create your master keyword list, watch this video next: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eofkzs0fVOA\n\nWhy is it important to know what is trending in the mass consciousness of your target market?\n\nEasy... People turn to Google's search bar for their deepest and most urgent questions.\n\nThe questions they search and the phrases they use to create a massive dataset that begins to paint a picture of the biggest desires within your audience.\n\nOnce you understand what the trending desires and questions are within your target market, you are able to create niche websites, articles, videos, podcast episodes, products and services to help your audience achieve their true desires.\n\nYou see, desire is not created within your audience... Their desires are already there.\n\nYour job as an internet marketer is to tap into their desires, answer their questions, help them avoid their fears and ultimately achieve their goals and desires.\n\nWhen you are able to see what questions, desires and fears are trending, in nearly real-time, you have a very clear picture of what content and products are being requested by your audience.\n\nThe Google Trends tool is the key to unlock this mystery behind your audience's deepest desires!\n\nThis video shows you how to use Google Trends in 2018, quickly and efficiently so you can get the information you need, fast... And so you can get back to the 'work' that is creating the content or products.\n\nWe start by looking at how to use Google Trends as a niche research tool, starting with the 'Vegan Dog Food' niche example I've used in several other videos.\n\nIf you are at this point, working on niche research, trying to find your main niche, be sure to check out my playlist on niche research that shows how to use other tools to do even more niche research:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZxKpnesTw&list=PL0sOKzn__yK3bPvVRts4CXOtPciYcu7iZ\n\nFrom here we move on to some big trending topics around Bitcoin and Ethereum looking at how the search volumes even track the price of these coins, to show how deep the Google Trends data truly goes.\n\nFrom here you will learn how to get additional topic ideas and keyword ideas from the Trends tool, too.\n\nThe third example is how to identify seasonal trends, patterns and potential challenges for niches that have very seasonal buying seasons.  Before entering a niche you need to know if it is consistent throughout the year or if it has low points through the year.\n\nIf there are low points, all is not lost... You will see how to find counter-seasonal topics or products to fill in your low season through this tool!\n\nFinally, we look at trends in diet patterns, from the New Year's bump to the long-term patterns in lifestyle diets vs. diet fads.  This gives a clear picture of what kinds of products people would purchase and what times of years would have the best chance to sell those products.\n\nIf you have a list in the health and wellness space, you could leverage this information to know exactly what day each year would be the most profitable to launch a specific product offer, whether it is your product or an affiliate offer.\n\nAgain, I believe it is through more effective and consistent market research that you unlock the opportunity to be more strategic than your competitors.\n\nMost people don't take the time to do the research... If you habituate the process of learning how to use Google Trends and the keyword research tool, you will find yourself gaining rankings in your blog, your YouTube channel and you will experience more conversions.\n\nMy other favorite research process for niche research and content marketing is keyword research.  You can get my full keyword research video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FfdjNOgpQ\n\nOnce you have the keywords and have created your content, you need to know how to implement those phrases into your content marketing... This free SEO course shows exactly what to do, where and why!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EI6JaFbv4\n\nHow To Use Google Trends, 2018 Update!

Their desires are already there.\n\nYour job as an internet marketer is to tap into their desires, answer their questions, help them avoid their fears and ultimately achieve their goals and desires.\n\nWhen you are able to see what questions, desires and fears are trending, in nearly real-time, you have a very clear picture of what content and products are being requested by your audience.\n\nThe Google Trends tool is the key to unlock this mystery behind your audience's deepest desires!\n\nThis video shows you how to use Google Trends in 2018, quickly and efficiently so you can get the information you need, fast... And so you can get back to the 'work' that is creating the content or products.\n\nWe start by looking at how to use Google Trends as a niche research tool, starting with the 'Vegan Dog Food' niche example I've used in several other videos.\n\nIf you are at this point, working on niche research, trying to find your main niche, be sure to check out my playlist on niche research that shows how to use other tools to do even more niche research:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZxKpnesTw&list=PL0sOKzn__yK3bPvVRts4CXOtPciYcu7iZ\n\nFrom here we move on to some big trending topics around Bitcoin and Ethereum looking at how the search volumes even track the price of these coins, to show how deep the Google Trends data truly goes.\n\nFrom here you will learn how to get additional topic ideas and keyword ideas from the Trends tool, too.\n\nThe third example is how to identify seasonal trends, patterns and potential challenges for niches that have very seasonal buying seasons.  Before entering a niche you need to know if it is consistent throughout the year or if it has low points through the year.\n\nIf there are low points, all is not lost... You will see how to find counter-seasonal topics or products to fill in your low season through this tool!\n\nFinally, we look at trends in diet patterns, from the New Year's bump to the long-term patterns in lifestyle diets vs. diet fads.  This gives a clear picture of what kinds of products people would purchase and what times of years would have the best chance to sell those products.\n\nIf you have a list in the health and wellness space, you could leverage this information to know exactly what day each year would be the most profitable to launch a specific product offer, whether it is your product or an affiliate offer.\n\nAgain, I believe it is through more effective and consistent market research that you unlock the opportunity to be more strategic than your competitors.\n\nMost people don't take the time to do the research... If you habituate the process of learning how to use Google Trends and the keyword research tool, you will find yourself gaining rankings in your blog, your YouTube channel and you will experience more conversions.\n\nMy other favorite research process for niche research and content marketing is keyword research.  You can get my full keyword research video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FfdjNOgpQ\n\nOnce you have the keywords and have created your content, you need to know how to implement those phrases into your content marketing... This free SEO course shows exactly what to do, where and why!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EI6JaFbv4\n\nHow To Use Google Trends, 2018 Update!

New Updates, Features, Products, and Integration", "description": "Google Assistant at CES 2019 - New Updates, Features, Products, and Integration\n\nGoogle is at CES 2019 in a big way, and I am going to bring you all the latest news, newest features, brand new products (with Google Assistant on board), and the newest integration capabilities for the Google Assistant.\n\nHighlights of this video: \n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18172082/google-assistant-connect-vs-alexa-interpreter-mode-maps-features-devices-ces-2019\n\nGoogle Assistant has been integrated (or will be) into Google Maps.  This will ensure Google Assistant goes out to a ton of new users.  There's also a new auto-reply and punctuation capability for messages on Google Assistant devices.  Broadcasting is the easy demonstration to make, but there's also messaging on Android phones.\n\nThe new interpreter mode is in real-time and lets you get real-time language translation, which we've seen in previous versions of Google's Pixel Buds.  There are also boarding pass options for you on flights in the US right now (although not many flights), and there's also the ability for more phones and tablets to access the Assistant while on the lock screen.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18172195/google-assistant-connect-e-ink-screen-gadget-smarthome-ecosystem-ces-2019\n\nThe biggest news as far as I'm concerned is the new Google Assistant Gadgets platform that Google is rolling out.  We saw an e-ink screen and a button being demonstrated at Google's CES area.  Both of them were relatively low-key devices that wouldn't take a lot to produce.  What's nice about this new platform is that it will drive small pieces of functionality in terms of Google Assistant Actions and in terms of routines, and ultimately, automation.\n\nNow for some of the new integration with existing products. Philips Hue now allows voice commands for the \"sun\".  March timeline.  Scheduling is possible, so I expect Routines.\n\nThere was confirmation that Google Assistant is coming to Sonos speakers...again, integration with Dish Hopper, and the new orbit B-Hyve sprinkler integration.  Samsung is also \"working very closely with Google\" to make Google Maps, Gmail, Google Play and YouTube work with Bixby.  This includes integration on their TVs as well.\n\nIn terms of new products at #CES2019, Google announced that there is over 1 billion Google Assistant enabled products on the market.  That's incredible.  Here are a few of the new ones:\n\nIn the Kitchen\n\nKitchen Aid Smart Display with Google Assistant will be $200-$300 in Q3 of 2019.  There's also the giant 27\" GE Kitchen Hub, which runs from $1200 - $1400 USD.  Instant Pot? Yes, please.  You'll need the Wifi Pressure Cooker model though.  There's also the Gourmia 11 in 1 multifunction cooker.  There's also new recipes integration with Innit, a mobile app that helps you filter by dietary restrictions and preferences.  Your Google Home Hub can get those recipes and videos.\n\nThe Bathroom\nThe SimpleHuman Smart Mirror has Google Assistant on it, a light, and speaker.  Two models for $350 - $400 USD.  Capstone Connected has the same, but with a touchscreen and Play apps!  Kohler released a whole set of bathroom products, and the U by Moen is a smart shower.  All have Google Assistant integration.\n\nIn the Bedroom, we saw a new smart alarm clock from Lenovo for $80 USD.  As for stereos:\n\nI love the look of the Marley Get together Mini at $199 USD.  Bluetooth and chargeable for up to 6 hours.  Klipsch put out a 48 inch, 48 W soundbar with Google Assistant, and the Citation series from Harman Kardon was added to.\n\nAll Over The House - A new Daiken One+ thermostat, TP-Link's new $50 1080p smart camera and a new light switch with the voice assistant on board, new C by GE Smart Lighting, and the Currant Smart Wall Outlet all came out at CES 2019. Ikea also has smart blinds!\n\nIn the car, the JBL Link Drive at $60 with noise cancelling abilities, and the Roav Bolt at $50 with charge ports. The Bolt is ready, JBL this Spring.\n\nAt the Door\n\nTons of new smart doorbells, locks, etc..  Onlink has a new doorbell which plays through other OneLink smoke detectors, TP-Link has a new wired smart doorbell with 2K HD video, and the new Maximus has two cameras on it (one watches your packages, one watches people).\n\nOut and About\n\nhttps://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/06/jabras-new-elite-85h-noise-cancelling-headphones-have-alexa-and-assistant-built-in/ - GA, Alexa, Siri support - Assistant built right in...except you say \"Assistant\" when that feature is enabled.\nhttps://www.cnet.com/pictures/see-all-the-latest-alexa-gear-from-ces-2019/15/ - Vuzix Blade smart glasses - takes video and photos, plays audio through headphones.
